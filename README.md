# Diona-Assignment– HTML/CSS/JS



## 📁 Description

This project contains two exercises based on converting real-world PDF forms into fully dynamic web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 🧾 Exercise 1: Medical & Travel Expense Request
Recreates a multi-section expense request form using dynamic tables for:
- Prescription Drugs
- Over-the-Counter Meds
- Medical Supplies
- Parking, Mileage, and Transport

### 📄 Exercise 2: Worker Progress Report
Rebuilds a worker's progress report with sections for:
- Return to work status
- Pain levels
- Medical treatment
- Exercises
- Medications and comments

---

## 💻 How It Works

Each exercise uses:
- 📄 `index.html`: layout of the page
- 🎨 `style.css`: form-like PDF styling
- 📜 `script.js`: dynamic rendering of data

Dynamic content is generated from JavaScript arrays/objects and rendered automatically in the browser.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download it.
2. Open each `index.html` file in your browser.
3. To change data, edit the JavaScript in `script.js` and refresh the browser.
